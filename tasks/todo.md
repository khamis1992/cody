# Cloudflare Pages 404 Fix - In Progress

## Issue: Site Returns 404 After Successful Build

### Problem:
- ✅ Cloudflare Pages build succeeds
- ❌ Site shows "404 - page can't be found" at https://cody-a93.pages.dev/

### Root Cause:
When we removed the `functions/` directory to fix Node.js module errors, we also removed the Cloudflare Pages Function entry point (`functions/[[path]].ts`) that tells Cloudflare how to serve the Remix application.

### Solution Applied:
Created a proper, minimal `functions/[[path]].ts` file that:
- ✅ Uses static imports instead of dynamic imports
- ✅ Doesn't reference Node.js built-in modules
- ✅ Delegates all routing to Remix
- ✅ Follows Cloudflare Pages + Remix best practices

---

## Implementation Status

### Step 1: Create Proper Functions Handler ✅
- [x] Created `functions/[[path]].ts` with correct implementation
- [x] Uses `@remix-run/cloudflare-pages` adapter
- [x] Static import of server build
- [x] Minimal, clean code (11 lines)

### Step 2: Deployment
- [ ] Test build locally (optional)
- [ ] Commit changes
- [ ] Push to GitHub
- [ ] Monitor Cloudflare Pages rebuild
- [ ] Verify site loads correctly

---

## Technical Details

### New `functions/[[path]].ts` Implementation:
```typescript
import { createPagesFunctionHandler } from "@remix-run/cloudflare-pages";
import * as build from "@remix-run/dev/server-build";

export const onRequest = createPagesFunctionHandler({
  build,
  mode: process.env.NODE_ENV,
  getLoadContext: (context) => {
    return {
      cloudflare: context.env,
    };
  },
});
```

### Key Improvements Over Previous Version:
1. **Static Import**: Uses `import * as build` resolved at build time (no dynamic imports)
2. **No Node.js Modules**: Removed all references to `crypto`, `fs`, `child_process`, `stream`, `process.env` checks
3. **No Manual Routing**: Removed custom route handling - Remix handles everything
4. **Cloudflare-Native**: Uses official `@remix-run/cloudflare-pages` adapter
5. **Simple**: Only 11 lines vs 159 lines of complex error handling

### Why This Fixes the 404:
- Cloudflare Pages needs a `functions/[[path]].ts` file to know how to serve the app
- This file creates a Cloudflare Function that catches all routes (`[[path]]`)
- The Function delegates to Remix's server build for SSR
- Static assets are served directly from `build/client`

## Previous Issues (All Resolved)

### Round 1: SSR Build Fixes ✅
- [x] Fixed import path in api.llmcall.ts
- [x] Added path polyfill support
- [x] Added istextorbinary to SSR bundle

### Round 2: Cloudflare Functions Build Errors ✅
- [x] Removed problematic functions directory
- [x] This caused the 404 issue we're now fixing

### Round 3: 404 Fix (Current) 🔄
- [x] Created proper minimal functions handler
- [ ] Deploy and verify

---

## Expected Outcome

After deployment:
- ✅ Build succeeds (should continue working)
- ✅ Functions bundling succeeds (no Node.js errors)
- ✅ Site loads at https://cody-a93.pages.dev/
- ✅ All routes work (/, /api/*, /pricing, etc.)
- ✅ SSR and client-side navigation both functional

## Deployment History

### Commit 1 (c9c9252): SSR Build Fixes
- Fixed import paths and polyfills

### Commit 2 (bc03e81): Removed Problematic Functions
- Removed functions/ causing Node.js module errors
- This inadvertently caused 404 error

### Commit 3 (Pending): Add Proper Functions Handler
- Create minimal, correct functions/[[path]].ts
- Fixes 404 by providing Cloudflare Pages entry point
