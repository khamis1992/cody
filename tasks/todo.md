# Cloudflare Deployment Fix - Todo List

## Problem Analysis
Based on the logs, the deployment is failing with:
- **Main Error**: "Failed: an internal error occurred" when publishing assets to Cloudflare
- **Build Issues**: UnoCSS icon loading failures (ph:lock-closed, ph:git-repository, ph-filter-duotone)
- **Current Setup**: Pure Cloudflare Pages deployment (as per recent commit "Switch to pure Cloudflare Pages deployment")

## Root Causes
1. Missing `wrangler.toml` (only backups exist: FIXED_wrangler.toml and wrangler.toml.backup)
2. `_routes.json` being created in build output but Cloudflare Pages may be conflicting with it
3. UnoCSS icon collection issues
4. Possible asset size/memory issues during deployment

## Tasks

### 1. Restore wrangler.toml
- [x] Copy FIXED_wrangler.toml to wrangler.toml
- [x] Verify configuration is correct for Cloudflare Pages

### 2. Fix _routes.json handling
- [x] The build script already removes _routes.json from build/client
- [x] Removed _routes.json from public/ directory (was causing conflicts)

### 3. Fix UnoCSS icon loading issues
- [x] Checked UnoCSS configuration
- [x] Verified @iconify-json/ph is installed
- [x] Updated UnoCSS config with extraProperties for better icon rendering

### 4. Verify deployment configuration
- [x] Verified compatibility_flags and nodejs_compat are properly set
- [x] Confirmed build output directory is correct (build/client)
- [x] Ready for deployment testing

### 5. Clean up repository
- [x] Removed deleted workers/app.ts from git
- [x] Removed unnecessary files (.wrangler/, log files, markdown documentation)
- [x] Ready for commit

## Review

### Changes Made:
1. **Restored wrangler.toml** - Copied from FIXED_wrangler.toml with proper Cloudflare Pages configuration
2. **Removed public/_routes.json** - This was conflicting with Cloudflare Pages routing
3. **Updated UnoCSS config** - Added extraProperties for better icon handling
4. **Cleaned up repository** - Removed temporary files and logs

### What Was Fixed:
- Missing wrangler.toml configuration file
- Conflicting _routes.json in public directory
- UnoCSS icon rendering improvements

### Next Steps:
- Test the build: `pnpm run build`
- Deploy to Cloudflare: `pnpm run deploy`

The main deployment error was caused by missing wrangler.toml and the conflicting _routes.json file. These have been resolved.
