## Review

### Issue Identified
The Cloudflare Pages build was failing with error:
```
[vite-plugin-static-copy:build] No file was found to copy on app/lib/modules/llm/providers/*.js src.
```

### Root Cause
The `vite-plugin-static-copy` configuration in `vite.config.cloudflare.ts` was attempting to copy `.js` files from `app/lib/modules/llm/providers/`, but this directory only contains TypeScript (`.ts`) files. The plugin was looking for files that don't exist.

### Solution
Removed the `vite-plugin-static-copy` configuration entirely:
- Removed the import statement for `vite-plugin-static-copy`
- Removed the plugin configuration block
- The `.ts` files are already handled by Vite's normal TypeScript compilation process

### Changes Made
**File**: `vite.config.cloudflare.ts`
- Removed: `import { viteStaticCopy } from 'vite-plugin-static-copy';`
- Removed: `viteStaticCopy` plugin configuration block

### Deployment
- Committed fix to git
- Pushed to GitHub repository (commit: d8a9f6c)
- Cloudflare Pages will automatically rebuild with the fix

### Expected Result
The Cloudflare Pages build should now complete successfully without the static copy error.
