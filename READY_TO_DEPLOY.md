## 🔍 Root Cause of Previous Failure

Your deployment log showed:
```
Line 695: Failed: an internal error occurred
```

**The Issues:**
1. ❌ `wrangler.toml` was causing auto-detection conflicts
2. ❌ `functions/` directory was interfering with Remix routing
3. ❌ Node 18.18.0 (deprecated) instead of Node 20
4. ❌ Wrong compatibility settings

**Now Fixed:**
1. ✅ No `wrangler.toml` in repository (using dashboard config)
2. ✅ No `functions/` directory
3. ✅ Node 20.11.0 configured via `.nvmrc`
4. ✅ Correct compatibility settings documented
